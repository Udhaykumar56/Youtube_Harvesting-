# Youtube_Harvesting-
Overview
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Project is a comprehensive data-driven initiative aimed at extracting, processing, and storing valuable information from YouTube using Python, MongoDB, and SQL. This project combines the power of Python for data extraction, MongoDB for flexible and scalable NoSQL storage, and SQL for structured data analysis and reporting.

Key Points
Data Harvesting with Python:
Harvested data includes video metadata, comments, likes, dislikes, and other relevant information.

Data Management using MongoDB and SQL:
The flexibility of MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data, accommodating the dynamic nature of YouTube data.

Data Processing and Transformation:
Python scripts are implemented to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data before it is stored in MongoDB and SQL databases.
